### Hello World ðŸ‘‹
I am a fullstack software engineer from Milwaukee, Wisconsin
<br>
Recently I started a software engineering program at Hackbright Academy, where I am gaining skills and knowledge in web development and computer science fundamentals. Prior to that, I accepted a position as a software engineer apprentice. I was responsible for team progress, DRY code, approving push requests, and meeting deadlines. Before that I worked as a sales manager, where I trained and mentored a team of 30 sales consultants. I loved being in sales but I've always loved working with computers. Programming provides me with challenging problems, allowing me to utilize my problem-solving skills to create solutions. I would love the opportunity to combine my education and skills into a software engineering position after Hackbright.
<br>
- ðŸ”­ Working on multiple Front End and Back End projects using Vue, JS, HTML, CSS, Java, Nodejs, and SQL
- ðŸŒ± Learning design patterns in depth
- Writing DRY, clean reusable code.
